       My name is  Akashdeep Singh, an international student hailing from Punjab, embarked on a journey to pursue my studies in Interactive Media Design. Filled with ambition and a desire to excel in my chosen field, I left my  homeland behind and embarked on a new chapter of my life.
       However, the transition has not been without its challenges. Adjusting to a new culture, language, and educational system has presented its share of obstacles for me . The initial excitement soon gave way to the realities of a different environment, leaving me feeling overwhelmed and struggling to find my footing
       Language barriers and cultural differences have posed hurdles in effectively communicating and integrating into my new academic and social surroundings. The intricacies of the Interactive Media Design program have proven to be a formidable challenge, requiring a steep learning curve to grasp the technical aspects and creative concepts involved.
        Yet, despite these difficulties, my determination and resilience shine through. Recognizing the importance of seeking support and guidance, I actively seeks assistance from professors, peers, and support services. Through hard work, perseverance, and a growth mindset, I strive to overcome  struggles and thrive in  academic pursuits.
        My passion for interactive media design continues to fuel my drive, as  it is a medium for expressing my creativity and making a meaningful impact. I remain committed to pushing through the barriers, honing my skills, and embracing new opportunities to expand my knowledge and experience in the field.
        While the path may be challenging, my journey is a testament to my determination and resilience. With each hurdle I overcomes,  grows stronger and more equipped to navigate the complexities of my chosen field.
